### Development

Just figure that shit by looking at the `package.json`, lazy biatch.

### Roadmap

#### backend crap
- [ ] revisit score saving if user was unlogged
- [ ] github invitation check
- [ ] global leaderboard, languages specific
- [ ] user stats, past races for profile (with historical data)
- [ ] join user room, websockets

#### frontend junk
- [ ] find a good way to choose a test: user may want to search into their repos, maybe search in the trending repos? on the high starred repos? (on freecodecamp?). after that, they want to search for a file into that repo. so it will be like a multi step form. has to be easy and fast and able to pilot via keyboard (no shit).
