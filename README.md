### Development

Just figure that shit by looking at the `package.json`, lazy biatch.

### Roadmap

#### backend crap
- [ ] "verified users", minor cheat detection, ban integration
- [ ] user stats, past races for profile (with historical data)
- [ ] join user room, websockets

#### frontend junk
- [ ] find a good way to choose a test: on the high starred repos? (on freecodecamp?). after that, they want to search for a file into that repo. so it will be like a multi step form. has to be easy and fast and able to pilot via keyboard (no shit).
- [ ] change score calculation (use cpm instead)
- [ ] improve textwriter to allow horizontal scroll, maybe code highlight for non-erroneous chars?
